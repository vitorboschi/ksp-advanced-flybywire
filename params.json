A built-in example preset is available.\r\n- Unlimited number of controller buttons and axes\r\n- Full keyboard & mouse support\r\n- Lower latency and better analog precision than KSP's stock input\r\n- Smart dead-zone detection and analog calibration \r\n- Remaps analog inputs to achieve better precision\r\n- Acceleration-based discrete inputs for precise keyboard flight\r\n- Supports key combinations with an infinite number of keys\r\n- Multiple presets per controller\r\n- Extremely simple to configure and use\r\n- Works alongside the stock input system. The mod will not override or break your current setup.\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\nThe mod adds a new button to the mod toolbar.\r\n![toolbar](http://i.imgur.com/uToMl2R.png)\r\n\r\nClick the game controller icon or press Shift + L during flight to bring up Fly-By-Wire's main configuration screen.\r\n\r\n![main](http://i.imgur.com/OrsIzF1.png)\r\n\r\nFrom there you will see a list of detected controllers. You can click on \"Enable\" to enable a controller from the list - two new buttons will appear - \"Presets\" and \"Configure\".\r\n\r\n\"Presets\" will open up the preset editor which is very similar to KSP's stock bindings editor. Using the preset editor you can modify your controller layout at any time.\r\n\r\n![presets](http://i.imgur.com/5vpxkxJ.png)\r\n\r\n\"Configure\" will open up the controller configuration screen. It allows you to set some configuration values as well as calibrate the controller if necessary.\r\n\r\n![config](http://i.imgur.com/zVRH39l.png)\r\n\r\nAfter setting up your controller you should save your game (by using quicksave or exiting to space center), which will automatically save your controller configuration as well.\r\n\r\n### Operating system compatibility\r\nFully tested and compatible with KSP x32 and x64 on Windows operating systems.\r\nLinux/ MacOSX support available but still in early testing.\r\nXInput support unavailable on Linux and MacOSX.\r\n\r\n### Performance considerations\r\nThe mod is extremely lightweight both on performance and memory. It only does a bit of arithmetic and remapping of incoming inputs which should have\r\nno noticeable effect on CPU usage. Memory usage is in the order of a few megabytes.\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\nThere is only one known limitation so far - most EVA controls are unavailable, you should continue using the stock input system for EVA.\r\n\r\n### Compatibility with other mods\r\nThe mod has been tested to work with over 50 of the most popular mods.\r\n\r\nHere is a (non-exhaustive) list of mods that have been tested to be compatible, in no particular order:\r\n- MechJeb\r\n- Ferram Aerospace Research (FAR)\r\n- KW Rocketry\r\n- OKS/ MKS\r\n- Kethane\r\n- Infernal Robotics\r\n- Kerbal Engineer Redux\r\n- ORS\r\n- PreciseNode\r\n- TextureReplacer\r\n- Deadly Reentry\r\n- Crossfeed Enabler\r\n- Chatterer\r\n- Environmental Visual Enhancements\r\n- TAC Life Support .. and more\r\n\r\nSome issues:\r\n- B9 Aerospace - loading crashes in the 64-bit build, 32-bit builds are unaffected\r\n\r\n### Roadmap\r\n\r\n- Linux/ MacOSX support\r\n- Support for controller hats and trackballs\r\n- EVA actions\r\n\r\n### Bug reports\r\nPlease report any bugs using [GitHub's issue tracker](https://github.com/AlexanderDzhoganov/ksp-advanced-flybywire/issues).\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\nv1.1.1\r\n- Fixed misinterpreted controller hat inputs\r\n\r\nv1.1\r\n- Fixed issue with FAR where FAR's dynamic control adjustment would get overridden\r\n- Fixed trim issues\r\n- Added wheel throttle and wheel steer\r\n- Fixed a bug where throttle wouldn't go below 50%\r\n- Support for controller hats both as axes and buttons (new \"Treat hats as buttons\" config option)\r\n- Fixed SDL plug and play\r\n- Fixed a preset editor bug where if time is slowed down (e.g. by using the TimeScale mod), it was not possible to change bindings\r\n- General optimization\r\n- Breaks the configuration XML, you will need to recreate your presets.\r\n\r\nv1.0.3\r\n- Fixed the issues with time warp\r\n- B9 Aerospace now supported for 32-bit builds\r\n\r\nv1.0.2\r\n- Added negative versions of Yaw, Pitch, Roll, X, Y and Z\r\n\r\nv1.0.1 \r\n- SDL2.dll wasn't always recognized to exist\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
